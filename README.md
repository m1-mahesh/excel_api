If python is installed in your system, then pip comes in handy.
So simple steps are:
1) Install virtualenv using

 > pip install virtualenv 

2)Now in which ever directory you are, this line below will create a virtualenv there

 > virtualenv myenv
 
And here also you can name it anything.

3) Now if you are same directory then type,

 > myenv\Scripts\activate

You can explicitly specify your path too.

Similarly like Linux you can deactivate it like

> deactivate

Now you have virtualenv install and activated on your machine.

4) Now you install all required dependencies from requirements.txt.

> pip install -r requirements.txt

5) Now you are Ready to go.

> paython main.py

Thank You.
